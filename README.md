# OpticalStress
A collection of short programs I have written (and will regularly update) on calculating the stress of an optic
Stress in thin-films is an on-going field of interest and research for both academics and people in industry.
Stress in thin films is a significant factor in the performance and reliability of many devices. Thin films are typically deposited on a substrate, and the stress in the film can be caused by a number of factors, including:
1. The difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the film and the substrate. When the film and the substrate are heated or cooled, the film will expand or contract at a different rate than the substrate, which can cause stress in the film.
2. The difference in the chemical composition of the film and the substrate. If the film and the substrate have different chemical compositions, the film may react with the substrate, which can cause stress in the film.
3. The deposition process itself. The deposition process can cause stress in the film due to the energy deposited into the film during the deposition process.
The traditional method of calculating stress is by using Stoney's equation. There are certain cases where additional changes to Stoney's equation may be required.
